- Determines WFH status based on:
  - Presence sensors (e.g., `device_tracker`, `person`)
  - Work device connection (e.g., binary sensor for Wi-Fi)
- Detects air conditioner running status and HVAC mode
- Creates a sensor entity: `sensor.work_from_home`
- Logs daily status to a CSV file (configurable path)
